**Alexander Graham Bell:** Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to focus.

**Sun Tzu:** It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle."

The way you train reflects the way you fight. People say I’m not going to train too hard, I’m going to do this in training, but when it’s time to fight I’m going to step up. There is no step up. You’re just going to do what you did every day.

Success - keeping your mind awake and your desire asleep
